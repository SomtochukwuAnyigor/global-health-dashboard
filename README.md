## 📌 Project Overview
<img width="1366" height="768" alt="Somto&#39;s first local data science project (Dashboard)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e1a95684-1924-4ffa-82cb-c6cd1adfa621" />

This interactive dashboard analyzes the global landscape of **Infant and Young Child Feeding (IYCF)** indicators, specifically focusing on the correlation between **Exclusive Breastfeeding (EBF)** rates and **Chronic Malnutrition (Stunting)**. 

### 🩺 Why This Matters (Clinical Context)
As a medical student, I designed this tool to bridge the gap between population-level data and clinical pathophysiology. 
* **Pathology Focus:** Highlighting the "Immunological Gap" caused by low EBF, which increases vulnerability to enteric infections and subsequent linear growth retardation.
* **Pharmacology Focus:** Addressing how stunting and protein-energy malnutrition affect pediatric pharmacokinetics (drug metabolism and distribution).

---

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Interactive Geospatial Mapping:** Visualization of global EBF rates using Plotly.
* **Clinical Insight Engine:** Automated medical commentary based on country-specific data.
* **Health KPI Metrics:** Real-time tracking of breastfeeding and stunting prevalence.
* **Cross-Country Comparison:** Benchmarking peer nations (e.g., Nigeria vs. Ghana) to identify successful community health models.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.12
* **Framework:** Streamlit (Web Deployment)
* **Data Handling:** Pandas (CSV parsing & cleaning)
* **Visualization:** Plotly Express (Interactive choropleth maps and bar charts)

## 📊 Data Source
Data is cross-referenced from the **UNICEF/WHO Joint Malnutrition Estimates (2024)** and the **Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS)**.
